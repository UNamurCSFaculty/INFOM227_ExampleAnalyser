# INFOM227 ExampleAnalyser

The aim of this project is to provide an example of a static code analyser and to remind people of the basics of creating languages.

The analyser has been implemented in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for several reasons:

- Scala natively supports Java libraries, including [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/), which is one of the best-known libraries for writing programming languages.
- Scala supports [Algebraic data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) and has powerful [Pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) capabilities, which makes it very easy to define a language and perform analysis on it.
- It provides a very good developer experience because there is a built-in [Gradle plugin for Scala](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/scala_plugin.html) and [Gradle plugin for ANTLR](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/antlr_plugin.html).
- Scala can treat [errors as values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_type) and this makes the management of compilation errors much clearer.


## Syntax

The syntax of a programming language determines what constitutes a valid program in terms of text. In almost all cases for programming languages, this syntax is defined using a [Context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). In the course and in this example, the grammars are defined formally using the [EBNF (extended Backus-Naur form)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_form) notation.


### Grammar

In this example, we will use the following grammar to define the syntax of our language:

$$
\begin{align}
& \langle DIGIT \rangle ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' \\
& \langle NUMBER \rangle ::= \langle DIGIT \rangle+ \\
& \langle LETTER \rangle ::= 'a' | 'b' | 'c' | ... | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | ... | 'Z' \\
& \langle IDENTIFIER \rangle ::= \langle LETTER \rangle (\langle LETTER \rangle | \langle DIGIT \rangle)* \\
& \langle program \rangle ::= \langle scope \rangle \\
& \langle scope \rangle ::= \langle declareStatement \rangle* \quad \langle statements \rangle \\
& \langle statements \rangle ::= \langle statement \rangle* \\
& \langle statement \rangle ::= \langle declareStatement \rangle | \langle assignStatement \rangle | \langle printStatement \rangle) | \langle ifStatement \rangle) | \langle whileStatement \rangle \\
& \langle declareStatement \rangle ::= \langle type \rangle \quad \langle IDENTIFIER \rangle ';' \\
& \langle assignStatement \rangle ::= \langle IDENTIFIER \rangle '=' (\langle expression \rangle | '\{' \langle scope \rangle \langle expression \rangle '\}') ';' \\
& \langle printStatement \rangle ::= 'print' \quad \langle expression \rangle ';' \\
& \langle ifStatement \rangle ::= 'if' \quad '(' \langle expression \rangle ')' \quad '\{' \langle statements \rangle '\}' \quad 'else' \quad '\{' \langle statements \rangle '\}' \\
& \langle whileStatement \rangle ::= 'while' \quad '(' \langle expression \rangle ')' \quad '\{' \langle statements \rangle '\}' \\
& \langle type \rangle ::= 'int' | 'bool' \\
& \langle expression \rangle ::= \langle disjunction \rangle \\
& \langle disjunction \rangle ::= \langle conjunction \rangle ('OR' \langle conjunction \rangle) | \langle conjunction \rangle \\
& \langle inversion \rangle ::= 'NOT' \quad \langle inversion \rangle | \langle comparison \rangle \\
& \langle comparison \rangle ::= \langle comparison \rangle ('<' | '>' | '==' | '!=' | '>=' | '<=') \langle sum \rangle) | \langle sum \rangle \\
& \langle sum \rangle ::= \langle sum \rangle ('+' | '-') \langle product \rangle | \langle product \rangle \\
& \langle product \rangle ::= \langle product \rangle ('*' | '/') \langle factor \rangle | \langle factor \rangle \\
& \langle factor \rangle ::= ('+' | '-') \langle atom \rangle | \langle atom \rangle \\
& \langle atom \rangle ::= \langle IDENTIFIER \rangle | \langle NUMBER \rangle | 'True' | 'False' | '(' \langle expression \rangle ')'
\end{align}
$$

By using this grammar, it is possible to check whether a text follows a certain format and therefore to verify the syntax of the programming language we want. However, this grammar cannot be directly converted into code that automatically checks whether text follows the syntax of our language. This is why we usually use tools such as ANTLR to do this for us. Even if this involves rewriting the syntax in a format that the tool supports, the use of ANTLR saves a lot of time by creating code that can recognise a language automatically. You can find the grammar described above in the format supported by ANTLR if you go to the file [src/main/antlr/be/unamur/info/infom227/cst/ExampleGrammar.g4](src/main/antlr/be/unamur/info/infom227/cst/ExampleGrammar.g4). If you open it, you'll see that it looks very similar to our grammar using the format the EBNF notation. The main difference is that the file is divided into 2 parts, the [Lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) part and the [Parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) part. The parser is responsible for converting text into words and removing unnecessary characters. **The order of the rules written here is important because the parser will use the first rule that matches the text to create the words.** This is why the keywords are above the identifiers. Without this, ANTLR would not be able to properly find the keywords. Then, there is the parser which is responsible for converting the sequence of words created by the lexer into a [CST (Concrete Syntax Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree). Thanks to the creation of this tree which uses the [Visitor design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern), it is then possible to easily check the semantics of the text that was written and to create an [AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) that only contains the relevant information in a format that is convenient for us.


### Concrete Syntax Tree

Here is an example of how some code can be converted into a CST using ANTLR and our grammar:

```
int a;
a = {
  int b;
  b = -a + b - 7;
  3 * 4 / b
};
```

![CST Example](docs/images/CST_example.png)

As you can see, with just 6 lines of code, this already represents a fairly large CST (If you are interested, this CST was generated using the [ANTLR extension for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4)). In addition, this tree has a strange shape because of the rules on expressions. Even if this seems strange, it's actually intentional because it allows to enforce the [Order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Programming_languages) directly at the syntax level and this is something that can be found in almost all programming languages ([Example with the Python grammar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html)).


## Semantics

Once the syntactic analysis has been performed using ANTLR, it is then possible to perform a [Semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) analysis. The semantics of a programming language define what happens when an instruction is executed, and what is computed by the expressions defined in the syntax. Indeed, if we see an expression `a + b`, how do we know that this means that it will return the result of the addition of the variables `a` and `b`? There's nothing to stop us saying that the `+` operator means subtraction. That's why we need to formally define the semantics of our language.


### Semantic rules

The semantics of our language are defined by the [rules of inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference) below:

$$
\begin{align}
[\text{Value}] & \quad \frac{v \in \mathbb{Z} \cup \{ True, False \}}{(v, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v} & \\
[\text{Var}] & \quad \frac{x \in < Var >}{(x, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \sigma(x)} & \\
[\text{Non-local var}] & \quad \frac{x \in < Var > \qquad x \notin dom(\sigma_s) \qquad (x, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v}{(x, \Sigma \bullet \sigma \bullet \sigma_s) \leadsto v} & \\
[\text{Op}] & \quad \frac{(x_1, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v_1 \qquad (x_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v_2 \qquad v_1 \oplus v_2 = v}{(x_1 \oplus x_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v} & \\
[\text{Simple assignment}] & \quad \frac{(e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v \qquad \sigma' = \sigma[x \mapsto v]}{(x = e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'} & \\
[\text{Sequence}] & \quad \frac{(s_1, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma' \qquad (s_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma') \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma''}{(s_1;s_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma''} & \\
[\text{If-True}] & \quad \frac{(e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto True \qquad (s_1, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'}{(if \quad (e) \quad s_1 \quad else \quad s_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'} & \\
[\text{If-False}] & \quad \frac{(e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto False \qquad (s_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'}{(if \quad (e) \quad s_1 \quad else \quad s_2, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'} & \\
[\text{While-True}] & \quad \frac{(e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto True \qquad (s; \quad while \quad (e) \quad s, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'}{(while \quad (e) \quad s, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'} & \\
[\text{While-False}] & \quad \frac{(e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto False}{(while \quad (e) \quad s, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma} & \\
[\text{Scope assignment}] & \quad \frac{(s, \Sigma \bullet \sigma \bullet \sigma_s) \leadsto \sigma_s' \qquad (e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma \bullet \sigma_s') \leadsto v \qquad \sigma' = \sigma[x \mapsto v]}{(x = \{s;e\}, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \sigma'} & \\
\end{align}

with:

- The symbol $\oplus$ corresponds to the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `==`, `and` and `or` with their mathematical semantics.
- The symbol $\mathcal{E}$ corresponds to the set of all possible environments.
- The symbol $\sigma$, with $\sigma \in \mathcal{E}$ and $\sigma : < Var > \mapsto \mathbb{Z} \cup \{True, False\}$, corresponds to the environment of the function currently being executed.
- The symbol $\Sigma$, with $\Sigma = \langle \sigma_0, ..., \sigma_n \rangle$, corresponds to the execution stack which is a sequence of environments.
- The notation $\Sigma \bullet \sigma$ splits the execution stack into the environment of the function currently being executed $\sigma$ and the rest of the execution stack $\Sigma$.
- The notation $(e, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto v$ corresponds to the evaluation of an expression $e$ with respect to an environment $\sigma$ and the rest of the execution stack $\Sigma$ and which produces $v$ as a value.
- The notation $\sigma[x \mapsto v]$ corresponds to the update of the environment $\sigma$ with the fact that $v$ is associated to $x$.
- The notation $(I, \Sigma \bullet \sigma) \leadsto \Sigma \bullet \sigma'$ corresponds to the fact of executing an instruction $I$ with respect to a state $\Sigma \bullet \sigma$ and yielding a state $\Sigma \bullet \sigma'$.
